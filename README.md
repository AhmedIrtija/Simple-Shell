# Simple-Shell
--- 
This project written in C that uses file manipulation, handling command line
arguments, creating a Makefile and making use of Unix-like system calls.

## How the Code Works

1. **Download MinGW to Run GCU**
    - Download MinGW [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

2. **Add MinGW Bin Folder to Your PATH**

3. **Compile the Code**
    - Execute the following command in the terminal:
      ```
      make
      ```

4. **Run shell related commands**
    - There should be a new line stating ```sshell@ucd$ ``` waiting for your command
    - Here's some built in commands
        - ```cd [directory]```
        - ```pwd```
        - ```exit```
    - Here are some other commands you can run
        - ```date```
        - ```echo [example]```
        - ```cat [file]```
        - ```grep```
        - ```ls```

5. **The commands work with output redirection**
